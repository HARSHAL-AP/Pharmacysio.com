T3 and T4 hormones regulate the body's metabolism and growth, whereas UTSH helps control the secretions of the thyroid gland. Problems like hair loss, dry skin, unexplained weight gain or loss, mood swings, muscle cramps, lassitude, depression or anxiety, constipation, menstrual irregularities and unexplained weakness are often associated with an underlying thyroid disorder."

          "desc":"The Rheumatoid Factor (RA) quantitative test helps to detect the levels of rheumatoid factor in the blood and to diagnose the presence of an autoimmune disease such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. A healthy immune system is vital to the functioning of the human body. The immune system protects the body against disease-causing microorganisms. However, immune deficiency diseases decrease the bodyâ€™s ability to fight invaders, causing vulnerability to infections. In response to an unknown trigger, the immune system may begin producing antibodies that, instead of fighting infections, attack the body's tissues. One such autoimmune disease is Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is caused by the presence of the rheumatoid factor, which is an autoantibody produced by the immune system. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease that is chronic (for a long time). It causes inflammation, stiffness, pain and gradually causes permanent joint damage. Usually, it occurs after the age of 40 years. Women are more prone to be affected by it as compared to men. A doctor may recommend the Rheumatoid Factor (RA) quantitative test if a patient is showing symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA quantitative test detects the level of rheumatoid factor in the blood, which aids in diagnosing autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. If the X-ray of the patient shows swelling in the joint capsules along with the loss of cartilage and bone, an RF test is advised. The results of a rheumatoid factor quantitative test are based on a blood sample"
